# Fix Home Navigation Across Deployment Platforms

## Problem
Home navigation was not working correctly across different deployment platforms (local, GitHub Pages, IPFS). Specifically:
- Clicking home links would navigate to incorrect base URLs
- Navigation behavior was inconsistent between platforms
- Mobile menu had duplicate click handlers

## Solution
1. Created a new utility function `getBaseUrl()` to dynamically determine the correct base URL based on the deployment environment:
   - Local development: `/`
   - GitHub Pages: `/ChadwickNFT/`
   - IPFS/other deployments: `/`

2. Updated Navbar component to:
   - Use consistent navigation handling across all links
   - Combine mobile menu click handlers
   - Maintain proper state management

3. Simplified router configuration in App.js to work with HashRouter

## Changes
- âœ¨ NEW: `src/utils/urlUtils.js` for deployment-aware URL handling
- ðŸ”„ UPDATED: `src/components/Navbar.js` with improved navigation
- ðŸ”§ FIXED: Mobile menu duplicate click handlers
- ðŸ§¹ CLEANED: Router configuration in App.js

## Testing Done
- âœ… Local development navigation
- âœ… GitHub Pages deployment paths
- âœ… Mobile menu interaction
- âœ… Modal state handling

## Screenshots
Before: Home navigation redirected to incorrect URL
After: Proper navigation across all platforms

## Notes
This change ensures consistent navigation behavior regardless of deployment platform while maintaining the existing user experience.
