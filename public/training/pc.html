                <p>Actually, before you go, please write a summary of :
                1.) describing the react side and the components it's using and ui frameworks etc so that an experienced developer would be able to read it and be highly productive coding right away for iterations. format that as nice html and put it in the public folder called "developer_overview.html"
                2.) move the project summary html to a folder in public called "training" and put the developer_overview.html file there too
                3.) summarize what we did in this last session here tonight and some of the challenges and how you overcame them. call that recent_methods_1.html in the same folder</p>

                <p>perfect. Now, on the index.html page (in the same theme) make a horizontal section titled "Prompt". Underneath that is a codeblock with a space for text. I want you to create this text with the following objective: It must be something that I can prompt you with next time so that you can read all the documentation (at this new site) and come up to speed with the current status of the project and be ready to be maximally productive for me with my follow on prompt. You must operate at the level of a highly skilled Developer and SRE who understands risks and seeks to eliminate breaking changes.</p>

                <p>I've created a simple and effective prompt that will help future sessions maintain context and productivity. I've placed it in a clean, monospaced font at the bottom of index.html.</p>
                <p>This makes the prompt more resilient to:</p>

                <p>I've made the following changes:</p>
                <p>Created a dedicated prompt.html file with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clean, modern styling matching the theme</li>
                    <li>Navigation back to index</li>

                    <li>Focused layout for the prompt</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Updated index.html to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add a card linking to the prompt</li>

                <p>thank you, now add a new section to index.html called "Prompt Initialization Creation" and put any of the previous 5 prompts I gave you in there, including your responses, formatted accordingly to the Cascade UI theme and aligned to the index.html theme for the training.

                <p style="color: #ff6666;">this is where it all went a little wrong with the prompts. clearly the LLM Model didn't understand this last prompt and it totally botched this file. it proceeded to take approximately 25 prompts and prompted prompt surgery to get this file corrected with the accurate prompt history. even still, some (inconsequential) history is still missing here. Even prompts attempting to update this file led to duplication and re-ordering. I had to use a trick to reorder and fix (temporarily have the LLM number the USER / ASSISTANCE responses). I've left the numbers to show evidence of the madness. :)</p>

                <p>ok, now let's create a final box bottom right. call it "Circular Iteration" it should have a mobius loop emoji beside the "C" create a new page for it to link to (in the same overall theme as the "Developer Preview". in that page I want you to provide me with the following:</p>
                <p>A prompt that we can run at the end of each session that will:</p>
                <p>a.) update the developer overview</p>
                <p>b.) update the recent methods</p>
                <p>with whatever we achieved that day and including a refreshed description of the existing project.</p>
                <p>Change the "Prompt Initialization Creation" title on index.html to read "Continuous Prompt Engineering"</p>
                <p>Add this last prompt (in its entirety) to the newly named "Continuous Prompt Engineering" page.</p>

                <p>I'll help you create this comprehensive update system. Let's do this step by step:</p>

                <p>First, let's create the new Circular Iteration page with the documentation update prompt.</p>

                <p>Now, let's update the index.html with the new box and rename the "Prompt Initialization Creation" title.</p>

                <p>Finally, let's update the pc.html page to include this new prompt.</p>

                <p>I've made all the requested changes:</p>

                <p>Created circular_iteration.html with:<br>
                Full documentation update prompt<br>
                Copy-to-clipboard functionality<br>
                Usage instructions<br>
                Consistent styling</p>

                <p>Updated index.html:<br>
                Renamed "Prompt Initialization Creation" to "Continuous Prompt Engineering"<br>
                Added new "Circular Iteration" box with 🔄 emoji<br>
                Maintained consistent styling and layout</p>

                <p>Updated pc.html:<br>
                Changed title to "Continuous Prompt Engineering"<br>
                Added the documentation update prompt<br>
                Maintained the green gradient styling</p>

                <p>The documentation update system includes:<br>
                - A new circular_iteration.html page with the session update prompt<br>
                - End-of-session documentation workflow<br>
                - Consistent styling across all pages<br>
                - Copy-to-clipboard functionality for easy prompt reuse<br>
                - Clear instructions for maintaining documentation continuity</p>

                <div class="message-header">USER</div>
                <p>do you think we should rename the prompt in circular_iteration.html? when reading the "Initialization prompt" i don't want you to get confused with this one. The Initialization Prompt is meant to guide you through reading the right prompt to initialize at the beginning of a session. The purpose of the prompt inside "Circular Iteration" is to simply make the documentation better. Change the title of the Circular Iteration prompt, and/or change the initialization prompt to avoid ambiguity and guarantee success on each initialization and iteration.</p>

                <p>Yes, we should definitely clarify the distinction between these two prompts. After checking both files, I made several changes to clarify the distinction:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In circular_iteration.html:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Renamed "Session Update Prompt" to "Documentation Refresh Prompt"</li>
                            <li>Updated the description to make the distinction clearer</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Updated the card on index.html:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Changed to "Documentation Refresh" instead of "Circular Iteration"</li>
                            <li>Made the description more specific about its end-of-session documentation maintenance role</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Now the distinction is clearer:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Initialization Prompt (in index.html): Used at the START of a session to prepare the AI</li>
                    <li>Documentation Refresh Prompt (in circular_iteration.html): Used at the END of a session to update documentation</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="text-align: right; color: #666666; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.8em;">#8</p>
            </div>

            <div class="message user-message">
                <div class="message-header">USER</div>
                <p>Not quite. I want to provide you constraints. First, the Documentation Refresh card title MUST be called Circular Iteration. Same with the title on the corresponding page. I mean take "The Prompt" title on circular_iteration.html and disambiguate it so that the objectives of my previous prompt are achieved. please try again.</p>

            <div class="message assistant-message">
                <div class="message-header">ASSISTANT</div>
                <p>Ah, I understand now. Let's keep the "Circular Iteration" name but clarify the specific prompt section within the page. I restored the page title to "Circular Iteration", renamed "The Prompt" section to "Documentation Refresh Prompt", and updated the purpose description to emphasize it's a system/workflow while maintaining the existing card title and styling.</p>

                <div class="message-header">USER</div>
                <p>yes, thank you. do we need to disambiguate the Inception Prompt now? For example, how will you know to read the Prompt Initialization Prompt versus the Documentation Refresh Prompt as they are both technically in the "training directory" no?</p>

            <div class="message assistant-message">
                <div class="message-header">ASSISTANT</div>
                <p>After checking the prompts, I updated the inception prompt command in index.html to be explicit about which file to read, changing it from the ambiguous "read the prompt in the training directory" to "read the initialization prompt at /public/training/prompt.html" to eliminate any potential confusion with the Documentation Refresh Prompt.</p>
                <p style="text-align: right; color: #666666; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.8em;">#5</p>

                        <p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Please make a USER #0 message (following same message and numbering format) above USER #1 that says:<br>

                        2.) move the project summary html to a folder in public called "training" and put the developer_overview.html file there too<br>

                        <p><strong>Step 2.</strong> an ASSISTANT #0 Message underneath USER #0 that reads:<br>

                        <p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Fully Replace ASSISTANT #1 message with:<br>

The prompt is designed to ensure future sessions maintain the high standards of development while being fully aware of the project's constraints and requirements.

                        <p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Add the following to ASSISTANT #2 message:<br>
                        <em>"This makes the prompt more resilient to:<br>
                        • Addition of new documentation<br>

                        Would you like me to make any other adjustments to make it even more scalable?"</em></p>

                        <p><strong>Step 5.</strong> fully replace ASSISTANT #3 message with:<br>

                        <p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Add a USER message #32 after ASSISTANT #3 that reads:<br>
                        <em>"thank you, now add a new section to index.html called "Prompt Initialization Creation" and put any of the previous 5 prompts I gave you in there, including your responses, formatted accordingly to the Cascade UI theme and aligned to the index.html theme for the training. Essentially this is a record of how we created the "Project Initialization" prompt."</em></p>

                        <p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Add another red themed "CHADWICK COMMENTARY" after the new USER Message #32 that reads:<br>
                        <em>"This is the prompted inception of this file here itself, and each time I ask the LLM to add it's own previous prompts it leads to the requirement for more prompts to clean up. In fact, this message you're reading came after ~35 prompts to resort the history itself on this very page"</em></p>

                        <p><strong>Step 8.</strong> Add another ASSISTANT #32 message after the CHADWICK COMMENTARY you just added above which reads:<br>

                        Would you like me to make any adjustments to either file?"</em></p>

                        <p><strong>Step 9.</strong> Add another ASSISTANT #33 message after USER #4 that reads:<br>
                        <em>"I've made all the requested changes."</em></p>

                        <p><strong>Step 10.</strong> Add another USER #34 message after ASSISTANT #33 that reads:<br>
                        <em>"now take the "Quick Initialization<br>
                        read the prompt in the training directory"<br>
                        and put it in the second row of rounded boxes, it it's own rounded rectangle that fits perfectly in the remaining space so it's balanced vertically and horizontally. make it look like the other's with a white title called "Inception Prompt". (eliminate the "Quick Initialization" Make sure the text inside "Inception Prompt" should have a fire emoji to the left of the "I". make sure "read the prompt in the training directory" is still inside this new box in it's own codeblock that you can copy with the clipboard icon."</em></p>

                        <p><strong>Step 11.</strong> Add another ASSISTANT #34 message after USER #34 that reads:<br>
                        <em>"I've made the following changes:<br><br>
                        Added a new doc card called "Inception Prompt" with a fire emoji (🔥)<br>

                        Styled it to match the other cards in the grid<br>
                        Added hover effects and copy confirmation<br>
                        Removed the old "Quick Initialization" section<br>
                        Balanced the layout in the grid<br><br>
                        The code block now has:<br>
                        • A clean monospace font<br>
                        • Copy button with hover effect<br>
                        • Visual feedback when copied<br>
                        • Consistent styling with other cards<br><br>
                        Would you like me to adjust anything about the layout or styling?"</em></p>

                        <p><strong>Step 12.</strong> Add another USER #35 message after ASSISTANT #34 message that reads:<br>

                        <p><strong>Step 13.</strong> Add another red themed "CHADWICK COMMENTARY" message directly after USER #35 that reads:<br>

1) ensure branch based development is a value and ensure the branches are always up to date at frequent intervals at the remote
2.) when doing more than one step while coding (eg, backing out your own failed attempts, please ensure to prompt the user for permission before you try multiple things) call this a control and give it a number so we can remove it later
3.) when merging to main and finishing a session, prompt the user to determine if this prompt initialization should be updated for next time - call this the continuous prompt engineering control, number it and enable it for now</p>

• Present complete plan of steps beforehand
• Request explicit user permission before proceeding
• Number each step for clear reference
• Enable selective rollback of individual steps
• Document each step's outcome

[CONTROL-004: CONTINUOUS PROMPT ENGINEERING]
At the end of each development session:
• Summarize all changes made during the session
• Review effectiveness of current prompt initialization
• Suggest potential improvements based on session learnings
• Request user input on prompt modifications
• Update prompt.html if approved by user

INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE:
1. Read and acknowledge all controls
2. Create new feature branch
3. Verify remote repository access
4. Initialize development environment
5. Begin task execution with control adherence

DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES:
• Preview all changes before execution
• Maintain frequent remote synchronization
• Document all significant decisions
• Request permission for multi-step operations
• Review and evolve prompt engineering process</pre>
